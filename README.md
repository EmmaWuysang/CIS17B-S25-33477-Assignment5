# CIS17B-S25-33477-Assignment5
I created this program using **NetBeans IDE.** It should run perfectly fine, and the files are all already connected to each other. It runs similarly to the sample outcome for the assignment! Just need to have all the files downloaded.
I will also upload pictures of the program running. I also went through commenting most operations/parts. Files will be in a folder. Download & run in your selected IDE, NetBeans preferred as I am not completely positive how this works in other IDE's, regardless the process should be similar. Again, I did use NetBeans and for **some reason my compiler abbreviates the data type names**, so excuse that- they all still stand and mean double, string and int (refer to program notes). Thanks!
Hope everything goes smoothly!
